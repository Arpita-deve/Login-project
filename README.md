# Login-project

To create a login page using JSP, design a simple form with fields for username and password. Use HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The form submits user input to a server-side servlet for authentication. The servlet processes the credentials, validates them, and redirects users based on the login outcome.

To create a registration page using CRUD operations with servlets, design a form in JSP for user input. Submit the data to a servlet that handles the creation of new user records. The servlet processes the input, interacts with the database to insert the data, and provides feedback on success or failure.
